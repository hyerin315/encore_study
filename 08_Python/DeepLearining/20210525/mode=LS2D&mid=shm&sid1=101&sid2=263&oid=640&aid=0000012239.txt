A Coupang delivery rider [JOONGANG PHOTO]     Coupang, which has been hit by numerous complaints about poor working conditions and possible work-related deaths, is introducing a program that will allow deliverymen to take a month of paid leave.      The company directly hires many of its delivery workers, while other companies use subcontractors.      Under the initiative called Coupang Care, delivery workers with health risk factors like high blood pressure or high blood sugar will get a month off and receive health education and a personalized health plan.      The company said the program has been developed with physicians and medical advisors and that it is a first in the industry.    During the four-week leave, delivery riders will receive full salary.      “Our employees’ health and safety are our utmost priority, and Coupang Care is just our latest initiative to provide employees the workplace they deserve,” Coupang said in a statement. “Labor standards for delivery drivers are a very important social issue in Korea, and we remain committed to raising these standards as an industry leader. As we continue rolling out Coupang Care, we will also share our know-how and experience running the program, which we hope will help improve working conditions for all drivers in the Korean logistics industry.”    Coupang has dropped steadily since it started trading on the New York Stock Exchange in March, with overhanging concerns about the health of the company’s workers a factor mentioned by investors.
